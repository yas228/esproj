# Step 1
Definition	of	ES	index	structure	and	mappings	 to	store	 film	data	according	 to	 the queries	described	in Step	3.

The	operations	to	create	 these	indices	and	mappings	must	be	included	in	 the	lab	case	PDF	document	to	be	delivered	as	part	of	the	lab	case.


# Step 2
Using	an	ES	instance,	deploy	 the	 structures	defined	in	 step	1.	 Index	HTML	pages	containing	 the	 data	 of	 each	 film.	 The	 Excel	 file	 provided	 with	 the	 images	 of	 the	posters	also	contains	links	to	the	HTML	pages	of	the	films.

NOTE:	in	order	to	implement	this	process,	the	 filter	HTML	Strip	Char	available	in ElasticSearch1,	the Tika2 library	or the	JSoup	Java	library	can	be	useful3.


# Step 3
Implement	the	queries	needed	to	run	the	following	searches	on	the	films	collection	built	in	steps	1	and	2:

# 1.	Films	about	the	World	War	II	produced	since	1980.
# 2.	Directors	with	the	highest	number	of	action	films.
# 3.	Films	about	LGTBQ	issues	available	in	the	collection.	Besides	the	list	show	also	the	number	of	films	per	year.
# 4.	Films	about	corrupt	politicians	in	Europe	and	the	United	States.

The	ES	queries	defined	must	be	included	in	the	PDF	document	to	deliver	as	part	of the	lab	case	as	long	as	the	results	obtained	for	each	one.	(limited	to	10	results	per	query)
